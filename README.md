**California Housing Market Data Mining Project

Overview**

This project aims to extract and analyze data on the California housing market to reveal insights on key metrics that determine housing prices. Various modeling techniques were employed, including split, test, train, linear regression, random forest regressor, and gridsearch with cross-validation.

**Data Source**

The dataset used in this project is the California Housing Prices dataset, which contains housing-related information for various districts in California. The dataset includes features such as median house value, median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and ocean proximity.

**Modeling Techniques**

The following modeling techniques were employed in this project:

**Split, Test, Train:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Linear Regression: A linear regression model was trained to predict housing prices based on input features.
**Random Forest Regressor:** A random forest regressor model was trained to predict housing prices, offering improved performance over linear regression.
**GridSearch with Cross-Validation:** Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search with cross-validation to optimize model performance.

**Results and Insights**

The analysis revealed several insights into the California housing market, including the most influential factors affecting housing prices and the performance of different modeling techniques in predicting prices.
